# MangOverlay

Mangoverlay is a graphical configuration manager designed for [MangoHud](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud). It facilitates the serialization and deserialization of the configuration  while providing a user-friendly graphical interface for configuration management. With Mangoverlay, users can easily prototype the layout of the HUD, simplifying the process. For reference, you can find a [sample configuration](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/blob/master/data/MangoHud.conf) available.

The development of the (de)serializer for the config format is taking place in the [serde_mango](https://github.com/nozwock/serde_mango) repository.
